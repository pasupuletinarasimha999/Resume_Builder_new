# Resume Display Issues - Todo List

## Issues to Fix

### 1. Right Panel Preview Display - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Preview panel shows resume very small due to `transform: scale(0.45)`
- **Solution**: Changed scale to 1 and adjusted container width to 500px
- **Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` lines 405-407

### 2. Heading Underlines Overlapping - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Underlines under headings are overlapping with the text
- **Solution**: Increased `paddingBottom` from 2px to 4px and `marginBottom` from 8px to 10px
- **Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` multiple heading style sections

### 3. Preview Panel Width - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Preview is only showing on one side and not utilizing full available space
- **Solution**: Increased preview panel width from w-96 (384px) to w-[500px]

### 4. Font Size Optimization - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Font sizes need adjustment for better preview readability
- **Solution**: Optimized all font sizes across education, experience, projects, and skills sections
- **Location**: Various styling sections in `src/app/page.tsx`

## New Features to Implement

### 5. Rich Text Editor for Description Fields - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Description fields are plain textareas without formatting options
- **Solution**: Added RichTextEditor component with bold, bullet points, numbering options
- **Location**: Created `src/components/ui/rich-text-editor.tsx` and updated section configs
- **Implementation**: Updated education, experience, and projects to use richtext type
- **Preview**: Added renderRichTextContent function to handle HTML in preview

### 6. "Present" Checkbox for Work Experience - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: No easy way to mark current employment in work experience
- **Solution**: Added checkbox with "Present" label beside end date field in experience section
- **Location**: Updated `src/components/ResumeSection.tsx` and experience section rendering
- **Logic**: When checked, automatically sets endDate to "Present" and disables end date input
- **Features**: Checkbox integration with proper state management

### 7. PDF Sync Issue - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Downloaded PDF was image-based (non-selectable text) with no margins
- **Solution**: Completely rewrote PDF generation using React PDF for text-based documents
- **Location**: Rewrote `src/components/PDFDownload.tsx` with @react-pdf/renderer
- **Improvements**:
  - **Text-based PDF**: All text is now selectable and copyable
  - **Proper margins**: 25mm margins on all sides (professional standard)
  - **Clean layout**: No preview styling artifacts, pure document format
  - **Rich content support**: Converts rich text to proper bullet points and formatting
  - **Professional styling**: Proper fonts, spacing, and section organization

### 8. Fix TypeScript Compilation Error - COMPLETED ✅
- **Problem**: Error: `Argument of type 'string | true' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'`
- **Solution**:
  - ✅ Added type guards using `typeof` checks before calling `formatDateToMMYYYY`
  - ✅ Fixed `MonthYearInput` component to accept `disabled` prop
  - ✅ Ensured `startDate` and `endDate` are strings before formatting
- **Result**: Build now compiles successfully without TypeScript errors
