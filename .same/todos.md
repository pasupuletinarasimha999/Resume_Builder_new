## Completed Fixes:

### PDF Formatting Issues Fixed:
1. **Proper A4 sizing**: PDF now generates with correct A4 dimensions (210mm x 297mm)
2. **Font scaling**: Fonts are properly scaled and maintained in PDF output
3. **Layout preservation**: PDF layout now matches the preview layout
4. **Better rendering**: Using proper canvas scaling and temporary container for accurate PDF generation

### Date Input Improvements:
1. **Month-Year Input Component**: Created a specialized input for date fields
2. **Auto-formatting**: Supports formats like "05-2024", "5-24", "May 2024"
3. **Present/Current support**: Handles "Present" and "Current" text
4. **Date visibility**: Dates are now always visible in resume preview when entered
5. **Better display**: Dates shown as "Jan 2024" format instead of "01-2024"

### Technical Improvements:
1. **Smart date parsing**: Handles multiple input formats
2. **Proper validation**: Validates month ranges (1-12) and reasonable year ranges
3. **Auto-completion**: Completes partial inputs (e.g., "5" becomes "05-2024")
4. **Better UX**: Clear placeholders and helpful formatting hints
